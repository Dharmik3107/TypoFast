  Finance: `Finance is the soul and blood of any business and no firm can survive
    without finance. It concerns itself with the management of monetary
    affairs of the firm how money can be raised on the best terms available
    and how the procured money can be devoted to the best uses. Hence the
    nature of finance relates to the process of arrangement and application of
    funds.
    Utilization of finance requires payment of fees, rent or any such cost to
    the provider of finance. Business raises funds and in exchange it has to
    pay a cost to suppliers of the funds. If the finance is arranged by issuing
    shares the firm pays dividend in return or capital payment in the form of
    bonus shares.
    Economic application of finance helps to earn profit which ultimately
    creates value for the firm. Finance administers economic activities,
    enhances efficiency of the business operation, and thus ensures creation
    of surplus.
    So it deals with the broad spectrum of business activities that are
    directed to increase the value of the firm. How the fund can be arranged
    with least cost consideration and how that can be applied with best uses
    determines the extent of value generated by a firm. Hence finance is
    value-oriented.`,
  MentalHealth: `Mental health is crucial and integrates a component of health. Mental health
    includes an individual’s psychological, emotional and social well-being. Proper
    mental health results in the proper mental functioning that result in being
    productive in activities, healthy and fulfilling relationships with other people and
    having the ability to cope and adapt to adversity.
    Proper mental health is essential in every stage of life – from childhood and
    teenage to adulthood. Throughout a lifetime, an individual can experience mental
    health issue at any point. This affects not only their mood and behavior but also
    changes their way of thinking, of looking at life and facing challenges.
    Even though mental health is a highly personal thing, what affects one person
    may or may not affect the other person; however, some significant factors
    contribute to mental health problems. These factors include life experiences such
    as trauma or abuse, biological factors such as genes or chemistry of the brain,
    and even the family history of mental health problems can affect an individual.
    Poor mental health is also linked with stressful work conditions, rapid social
    changes, gender discrimination, gender discrimination, social exclusion, physical
    illness and human rights violation.
    Mental health problems are common, but for the longest time, people have
    avoided the entire concept of it and taken mental health for granted. At one point,
    mental health was considered taboo, and anyone seeking help was labelled as
    mentally ill. Mental health and mental illness are not similar things.`,
  Startups: `In recent years, startups have been receiving increased attention in many
    parts of the world. In India, the number of startups has increased fast and
    more support has become available in all dimensions. It is due to vast
    commercial potential for startups, India is often described as “the poster
    child of emerging markets”.
    Today Startups are being widely recognized as important engines for
    growth and jobs generation. Through innovation and scalable
    technology, startups can generate impactful solutions, and thereby act as
    vehicles for socio-economic development and transformation.
    A new campaign named as Startup India, Standup India was announced
    by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech on
    Independence Day 2015. This is an effective scheme launched on 16th
    of January 2016 by the Modi government to help youths of the country.
    This is an initiative by the Indian PM to give opportunities to the youths
    to become industrialists and entrepreneurs which need the establishment
    of a startup network. Startups means youths of the country will be
    supported through finance from banks to strengthen those startups better
    so that they can create more employment in India.This programme is a big start to enable startups through financial
    support so that they can use their innovative ideas in right direction.`,
  GlobalWarming: `Global warming is the latest alarm bell for earth’s environment. Global warming
    refers to the increase in average temperature of earth’s surface during the last
    century, from 1900-2000. Earth’s surface’s temperature has increased more than
    one degree Fahrenheit since 1900. Global warming is alarming because of its
    adverse effects on the ecological balance of earth. The resultant ecological
    imbalance, due to global warming, is the root cause of various natural calamities
    like floods, famines, etc. Also it is the root cause of various environmental threats
    like increase in sea level, glacier melting, changes in quantity and pattern of
    rainfall, heat waves, extreme seasons, etc. This is why global warming is the
    buzzword of almost all environmental talks, projects and discussions, etc.
    Global warming is a threat to the very existence of life on earth. Not only human,
    but any other form of life, be it flora or fauna face a threat in the face of global
    warming. Hence, it has became the pungent need of the hour to root out the
    causes of this threating phenomenon.
    The most evident causes of global warming are industrialization, urbanization,
    deforestation, sophisticated human lifestyle and related human activities. These
    human activities and trends have led to increased emission of greenhouse gases
    like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. These gases in turn has led to
    an increase in average temperature of earth’s surface, hence global warming history.`,
  CryptoCurrency: `A cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that is highly secured by
    cryptography or encryption techniques which makes it nearly impossible
    to counterfeit such cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency is an alternative means of exchange and the transactions
    of crypto are highly secured using cryptography. Crypto is electronic
    money or we can say that it is a type of virtual money. The power of
    governing or controlling the distribution of Cryptocurrency does not lie
    in the hands of the government or any single authority. It is a
    decentralized body shared over different networks. Crypto is widely
    accepted by people all around the globe.
    These crypto currencies are designed to work as a medium of exchange.
    Crypto currencies are generally not issued by the government agency of
    any country. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency networks

  EVehicle: `Today when the world is thriving to use day by day new technology
    everywhere, Electric Vehicles must be the future means of transport.
    Pollution, growing demand for fuel, Global Warming, promoting ecofriendly means of transport are some of the reasons for promoting
    electric vehicles.
    Electric Vehicles are means of transport that consume eclectic energy as
    fuel instead of traditional fuels such as petrol, diesel, and CNG. These
    vehicles may be powered through a collector system by electricity from
    off-vehicle sources or maybe inbuilt with a battery, solar panels, fuel
    cells, or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity. Electric bikes,
    electric cars, electric rickshaws, etc. are some examples of electric
    vehicles. Most of the trains including metros are already running
    worldwide through electricity.
    An electric vehicle uses one or more electric motors or traction motors
    for propulsion. The power of a vehicle electric motor, as in other
    vehicles, is measured in kilowatts (kW). Usually, direct current (DC)
    electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to
    alternating current (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected
    to a 3-phase AC motor.
    EVs can be made more or less efficient, polluting and expensive to run,
    by modifying the electrical generating stations. This would be done by
    an electrical utility under a government energy policy, in a timescale
    negotiated between utilities and government.

  DebitCard: `A debit card is a payment card that deducts money directly from a
    consumer’s checking account when it is used. Also called check cards or
    bank cards, they can be used to buy goods or services; or to get cash
    from an automated teller machine or a merchant who'll let you add an
    extra amount onto a purchase.
    Debit cards eliminate the need to carry cash or physical checks to make
    purchases, and they can also be used at ATMs to withdraw cash.
    Debit cards usually have daily purchase limits, meaning it may not be
    possible to make an especially large purchase with a debit card.
    Debit card purchases can usually be made with or without a personal
    identification number (PIN).
    You may be charged an ATM transaction fee if you use your debit card
    to withdraw cash from an ATM that's not affiliated with the bank that
    issued your card.
    Some debit cards offer reward programs, similar to credit card reward
    programs, such as 1% back on all purchases.
    A debit card is usually a rectangular piece of plastic, resembling any
    charge card. It is linked to the user's checking account at a bank or credit
    union. The amount of money that can be spent with it is tied to the
    account size (the amount of funds in the account).

  Business: `The act of making one’s living by earning money through the process of
    buying and selling different kinds of products is called business.
    Business is based on the foundation of profit and loss; thus, the success
    or failure of a business has a broad spectrum of variations.
    Business plays a major role within our society. It is a creative and
    competitive activity that continuously contributes to the shaping of our
    society. By satisfying the needs and wants people cannot satisfy
    themselves, businesses improve the quality of life for people and create
    a higher standard of living.
    It is a way for individuals to provide goods and services to consumers,
    and at the same time, produce a profit for themselves. Businesses are not
    only important because they provide goods and services for consumers,
    but they also improve the economy and increase jobs for people within
    society which is an additional fact producing a higher standard of living.
    The term business also sometimes refers to a ‘company.’ But, business
    as a generalized term can refer to the work of a street peddler to the
    ownership of a multinational company.
    Business is a very demanding profession that has broadened and
    popularized over the years. A business requires high skills of
    management, teamwork, patience, mental strength, and effectiveness of
    work.`,
