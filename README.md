# TypoFast

A simple application that tests users' typing speed and displays the results in words per minute.

## Features

- Users can start a typing test by typing a passage of text.
- The application displays the user's typing speed in words per minute as they type.
- The user's typing speed is calculated based on the number of words they type correctly in a minute.

## Future Plans

- In future versions of this project, users will be able to create an account and view their typing speed history.
- This project will be converted from a React-only application to a MERN stack application, with a MongoDB database for storing user data.

## Technologies Used

- This application was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
